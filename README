## Description
1. Huffman encoding scheme is used for compress a given file by encoding it.
2. Main idea of the scheme is to take the min two probabilities and make two children of a new parent node.
3. We have created an object node and recursively construct the tree.
4. All the definition of the function is in "My_Module_huffman.py" file and "Huffman_Encoding.py" is the driver code.
4. input file: Huffman_input.txt and output file : Huffman_output.txt, which contains the encoding of the input file.
